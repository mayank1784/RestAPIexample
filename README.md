# RestAPIexample
This is a simple RESTful API built with Node.js and Express. It provides a basic example of how to create endpoints, handle HTTP requests, and interact with a database using MongoDB.

## Installation
To use this API, you'll need to have Node.js and MongoDB installed on your system. Then, you can follow these steps:

1.Clone this repository to your local machine:
Copy code
'''bash
git clone https://github.com/mayank1784/RestAPIexample.git
'''
2.Install the dependencies using npm:
Copy code
'''bash
cd RestAPIexample
npm install
'''
3.Start the server:
'''sql
Copy code
npm start
'''
4.Access the API at [http://localhost:3000]
## Endpoints
This API currently provides the following endpoints:

### Endpoint	Method	Description
'''bash
/api/users	GET	Retrieve all users
/api/users/:id	GET	Retrieve a single user by ID
/api/users	POST	Create a new user
/api/users/:id	PUT	Update a user by ID
/api/users/:id	DELETE	Delete a user by ID
'''

All these endpoints return JSON data and use the HTTP status codes to communicate the outcome of the request.

### Database
This API uses MongoDB as its database. The connection details are stored in a .env file, which you should create in the root directory of the project with the following structure:

makefile
Copy code
'''bash
DB_HOST=<your-mongodb-host>
DB_PORT=<your-mongodb-port>
DB_NAME=<your-database-name>
Replace the placeholders with your own values.
